# The Data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity 
at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed 
by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, 
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 

The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 

From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 
See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 


## For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


## The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': 	Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': 	List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': 	Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': 	Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': 	Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': 	Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity. Range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. 

## Notes on the Dataset: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt' is not used in the course assignment
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt' is not used in the course assignment
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt' is not used in the course assignment


# The Variables

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and 
gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and 
angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 

## These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

## The set of measurements that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.


## Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

## Notes on the variables:
- Only variables with mean() and std() measurements are used in this assignment.
- The 'f' prefix to indicate frequency domain signals. 
- The 't' prefix to denote time.  
- That '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


# Course Assignment Details
 
The purpose of the Getting and Cleaning Data assignment is to demonstrate our ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

In this assignment I create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following (with fun examples):

1. Collect and read the data sets. 
	[download.file and read.csv]
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
	[bind_cols() and bind_rows()]
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	[grep()]
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
	[left_join()]
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	[gsub()]
6. Create a second, tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
	[group_by() and summerise_all()]
