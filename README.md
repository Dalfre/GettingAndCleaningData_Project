# GettingAndCleaningData_Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### The course project is the final assignment of the third course, "Getting and Cleaning Data", in the "Data science specialisazion". 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
We are working on a dataset that represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
See http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones for more info.

## The course project:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## This repo includes three files:
1. run_data.R - The script that does the described project goals. Further explanations of the functions and workings of the script are found as notes in the script.
2. CookBook.md - Detailed info about the data, variables, measurements and functions used in the assignment.
3. README.md - You are.
